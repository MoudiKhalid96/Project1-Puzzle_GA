## FAVORITE FUNCTION
There are 3 functions, and I find the **moveSquare** is the favorite, it starts with taking an argument when clicking on the square. In case you clicked on the white square nothing will happen, you have to click on the one with the image. It'll try to detect if the white square is up, down, left, or right by comparing the rows and columns. Once it knows it was near the clicked square (on right, left, up, down of the clicked square), it'll move, otherwise, nothing will happen.
